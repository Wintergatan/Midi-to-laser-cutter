# Warning

**This project environment is setup to work on windows. I can not guarantee it will work in other environments**.

# Prerequisites

You will need [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en/) or node package manager.

IDE that supports [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). I recommend [Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

This project uses Angular 2 as a framwork. If you do not know it here are some places to start.

[angular.io](https://angular.io/) and
[egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/get-started-with-angular-2)

# Getting started

Open CMD in the same folder as package.js.

Type and run `npm install`

This will download all dependencies.

Type and run `npm run build:dev`

This will build the project to the dist folder and watch the project files.
First run will takes some time but the next after that will be way faster.
If you make changes to the files it will automatically rebuild the project.

Open a new CMD and type and run `npm run server`

This will server the file from a small server and it should open a browser on the correct page.

Happy coding.
